Details about the app can be found in my blog post: [kdrozd.pl/map-of-localities-matching-the-pattern](https://kdrozd.pl/map-of-localities-matching-the-pattern/)

## Libraries and data used

The localities data comes from the [National Register of Geographical Names](https://www.geoportal.gov.pl/dane/panstwowy-rejestr-nazw-geograficznych).

[zcreativelabs/react-simple-maps](https://github.com/zcreativelabs/react-simple-maps) library was used to render the map.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
