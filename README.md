# Simple app marking places that match a pattern on a map (Poland only)

The places data comes from the [PRNG](https://www.geoportal.gov.pl/dane/panstwowy-rejestr-nazw-geograficznych).

The map model (shapefile) comes from [GADM](https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html)

[react-simple-map](https://github.com/zcreativelabs/react-simple-maps) library was used to render the map.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
